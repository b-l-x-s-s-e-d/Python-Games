1. Download BOTH the Tank Game.py file AND the save.json file, as the save.json file is needed if you want your progress to save
2. Drag BOTH the Tank Game.py and the save.json to your desktop/anywhere on your PC. Make sure they are both in the same location!!
3. Run the Tank Game.py, and any progress made should automatically update the save.json file, resulting in saved progress
4. If you want to edit the save.json file, I can't stop you, but it ruins the fun of the game, so there's no point :3
