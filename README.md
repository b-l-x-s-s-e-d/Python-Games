# 🚀 Tank Game 🚀

## Getting Started

To run the Tank Game correctly and ensure your progress saves, you **must clone or download the entire repository**. Downloading individual files may cause issues with saving or other features.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the full repository**
   - Click **Code → Download ZIP**, or
   - Clone using Git:
     ```
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   Make sure **all files and folders** are included.
   
3. **Keep all files together**
   - Do NOT move `Tank Game.py` out of the repository folder.
   - Files such as `save.json` must remain in the same directory structure.
  
4. **Run the game**
   - Open `Tank Game.py`
   - Any progress you make will automatically update `save.json`.

## Saving Progress

- All progress (stats, unlocks, upgrades, etc.) is stored in `save.json`.
- As long as the file remains in the repository folder, your progress will save between runs.

## ⚠️ Editing save.json

You *can* manually edit `save.json`, but doing so removes the challenge and intended progression of the game.
Play it normally for the best experience 🙂

Enjoy the game!
